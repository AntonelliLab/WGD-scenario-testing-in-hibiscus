# WGD-scenario-testing-in-hibiscus
Testing different scenarios of WGD using the [WGDgc package](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~ane/wgd/).

`WGDgc` is not available on CRAN. It must be installed independently. Use the script `install_packages.R`.

To reproduce results, run `scenario_testing.R`. This script makes use of custom functions stored in `tools/`.

All results can be found in `results/`. Raw data used in the analysis can be found in `data/`.
